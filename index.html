                <br>
                <p class="card-text">Flowers are considered the decoration of our life. They are all beautiful, without exception, which is why they are called the eyes of nature. Very often, people with good looks are compared to flowers. They say to a woman that she is beautiful like a rose, or has blossomed like a flower. It is always nice to receive flowers as a gift, for any occasion.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Crocus, or saffron, as this delicate plant is called, is one of the first to bloom in the spring. These flowers bloom on thaws and often come in different colors, decorating the ground like a living carpet. Reaches towards the sun with its mother-and-stepmother yellow heads. They paint the forest glade into a purple carpet of gorse and honeysuckle. They are early-flowering plants that bloom before the leaves break out on the banks and pines. With their appearance, everywhere becomes warmer, the sun shines much brighter.

                    Among the garden flowers in the spring, a flower bed of tulips and daffodils pleases the eye. And what delicate and fragrant hyacinths! At the beginning of May, the meadows turn yellow from the flowering of dandelions. Many people are delighted by the appearance of May lilies of the valley. They grow in forest thickets and do not like bright sunlight. Their touching flowers resemble small white bells that release a unique, wonderful aroma into the air. How nice it is to receive a simple, delicate bouquet of lilies of the valley as a gift!
                    
                    Presented flowers are, first of all, a sign of another person's attention.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="card-text">A big problem in our country and all over the world is the attitude towards nature. People no longer notice the beautiful nature around them, they cut down forests, drain swamps, kill animals, build factories and pollute nature. In many countries, nature protection organizations have been established, but these are very few, because people continue to brutally destroy nature without realizing what they are doing. Nature is our life.

                    There will be no nature - there will be no us. When destroying forests, building factories in these territories, people think only about money and profit, and not at all about nature, about beauty, about animals and even about their normal future life. I think it's not normal, it's terrible, people are destroying nature by destroying themselves. And no one realizes that we are part of nature. 1 if this attitude towards nature does not change, a terrible inevitable disaster awaits our Earth, and people will be to blame for it. Perhaps, over time, people will understand what they are doing, but it will be too late, and no one will return us clean air, animals, forests, our dear native nature.</p>
